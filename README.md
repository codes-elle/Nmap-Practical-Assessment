**Assignment: Nmap Performance-Based Questions**

**Instructions:**
- Perform the tasks using Nmap, and provide the requested information.
- Make sure to document your commands and the results obtained.
- Assume you are working in a controlled environment, and you have permission to scan the specified networks.

---

**Question 1: Basic Host Discovery**
- Task: Use Nmap to perform a basic host discovery on the target network (10.0.0.0/24).
- Question: What are the live hosts on the network? Provide IP addresses and their corresponding hostnames if available.

---

**Question 2: Port Scanning**
- Task: Perform a TCP SYN scan on one of the live hosts from the previous question (choose an IP address).
- Question: List the open ports on the selected host. Include the service name and version if possible.

---

**Question 3: Service Version Detection**
- Task: Choose one of the open ports from the previous question and perform service version detection.
- Question: What is the version of the service running on the selected port? Provide details.

---

**Question 4: Aggressive Scan**
- Task: Perform an aggressive scan on a live host of your choice.
- Question: What additional information did you obtain with the aggressive scan? Provide noteworthy findings.

---

**Question 5: Operating System Detection**
- Task: Use Nmap to perform operating system detection on a live host.
- Question: What is the probable operating system running on the selected host? Include the confidence level provided by Nmap.

---

**Question 6: Scripting Engine**
- Task: Utilize Nmap's scripting engine to perform a script scan on a live host.
- Question: Identify and describe one useful script that provided valuable information during the scan.

---

**Question 7: UDP Port Scanning**
- Task: Perform a UDP scan on a live host.
- Question: List any open UDP ports and the corresponding services running on them.

---

**Question 8: Firewall Evasion Techniques**
- Task: Experiment with Nmap's firewall evasion techniques (e.g., fragmentation) on a live host.
- Question: Did the evasion techniques help in bypassing any firewalls or filters? Describe the results.

---

**Question 9: Scan Timing and Performance**
- Task: Perform a scan with different timing options (e.g., -T1, -T3, -T4) on a live host.
- Question: Compare the results and discuss the impact of timing on scan performance and accuracy.

---

**Question 10: Custom Scripts**
- Task: Develop a custom Nmap script (in Lua or another suitable language) to perform a specific task of your choice (e.g., banner grabbing).
- Question: Provide the script code and explain its functionality. Execute the script and show the results on a live host.

---

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit a document containing your answers, commands used, and the results obtained.
- Clearly label each question and provide detailed explanations where necessary.
